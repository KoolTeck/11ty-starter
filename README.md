# 11ty Starter

The goal of this project is to bring together what I believe are most pragmatic and performant frontend frameworks and tools into a cohesive template for making web development wonderful.

So far, this template includes:

- 11ty
- AlpineJS
- Axios
- JSON-Server
- Rollup
- Svelte
- TailwindCSS

## Get Going

- clone the repo (duh)
- `npm i` to grab dependencies
- `npm run dev` to fire up dev server
- `npm run build` to build static site
