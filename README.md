# 11ty Starter

The goal of this project is to bring together what I believe are most pragmatic and performant frontend frameworks and tools into a cohesive template for making web development wonderful.

So far, this template includes:
- 11ty
- Babel
- ESLint
- Svelte
- TailwindCSS
- Webpack

## Get Going
- clone the repo (duh)
- `yarn` to grab dependencies
- `yarn dev` to fire up dev server
- `yarn build` to build static site
